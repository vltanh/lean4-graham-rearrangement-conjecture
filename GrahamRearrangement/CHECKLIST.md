## Completion rule

A checkbox is checked only when the corresponding paper definition/claim has been represented faithfully in Lean and its paper-internal proof has a theorem body with no `sorry`. Under the final Palomar-style boundary, the project contains no custom axioms. Results cited from external literature are formalized in the `External/` hierarchy using proved mathlib infrastructure. Merely stating a result is not completion.

For each numbered result, preserve:
- the exact quantifier order and domains;
- all positivity, primality, cardinality, and range hypotheses;
- strict versus non-strict inequalities;
- every named constant and numerical factor used by the paper;
- the paper's uniform probability law and conditioning;
- the distinction between a theorem proved in this paper and a theorem imported from the literature.

If an equivalent Lean reformulation is used, prove an explicit equivalence to the paper statement.

## 0. Fidelity and representation gates

- [x] Pin the target to arXiv:2602.15797v1.
- [x] Add a source map from every Lean declaration to the paper section/result/equation it formalizes.
- [x] Use the PDF/TeX as the authority whenever the experimental HTML disagrees with it.
- [x] Record the Section 3 prose inconsistency: the PDF says D_t \ B_{32t} in two transition sentences, while Lemmas 3.2/3.3 and the final proof use B_{2000t}; formalize the numbered lemmas/proof with 2000t and document this paper typo instead of silently changing it.
- [x] Audit the balanced-partition sentence in Section 3 against TeX/PDF before encoding its block-size formula.
- [x] Decide on one indexing representation for {1,...,n}; if Fin n is used, provide explicit translation lemmas so every paper interval [a,b] has the same endpoints and cardinality after the 0-based conversion.
- [x] Do not silently strengthen a paper condition such as a < b to a ≤ b; prove any strengthening is equivalent under the paper's hypotheses.
- [x] Model finite subsets as Finset where appropriate, but prove that every cardinality/set-operation formulation matches the paper's subset notation.
- [x] Model uniformly random finite objects by an explicit finite probability space or an exactly equivalent cardinality ratio.
- [x] Prove all claims that a conditional object is “uniformly random” rather than treating them as informal sampling facts.
- [x] Prove all invariance claims under fixed permutations/bijections that the paper uses when replacing σ by σ ∘ π.
- [x] Keep the exact real-valued constants until the final inequality; do not replace them by asymptotic O-notation.
- [x] Preserve provenance for external inputs, but formalize the required results as theorem bodies. In particular, the Janson–Łuczak–Ruciński hypergeometric estimate is developed under `External/Hypergeometric/` rather than left axiomatic.
- [x] Add a specialized formal hypergeometric tail lemma strong enough to yield the paper's e^{-k/32} and e^{-k/24} bounds if mathlib does not already provide it.
- [x] Final audit: every Lean source file is free of `sorry`, `admit`, and custom `axiom` declarations.
